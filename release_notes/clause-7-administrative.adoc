[[Clause_Administrative]]
== Description of Administrative Changes
This section enumerates the editorial and corrective changes done from the previous version of this Standard.
The corrections address issues in the previous version which could result in interoperability issues, and as a result implementations are encouraged
to migrate to this newer version. The previous version will likely be deprecated.

=== Title was renamed to include "tileset metadata"
The title of the document was renamed from "Two Dimensional Tile Matrix Set" to "Two Dimensional Tile Matrix Set and Tile Set Metadata" to reflect the fact
that the TileMatrixLink class which served the simple purpose of identifying a TileMatrixSet being used, as well as the limits of a particular tile set,
has been replaced by a more comprehensive set of metadata about the tile set, including the description of data layers to better support vector tiles use cases.

The document has also been re-organized to more clearly separate into dedicated sections the concepts, schemas, encodings and examples treating with
either the definition of the tile matrix set or of the tile set metadata.

=== Correcting axis order confusion for the EuropeanETRS89_LAEAQuad TileMatrixSet
The previous version of this Standard mistakenly assumed a wrong CRS axis order for the _EuropeanETRS89_LAEAQuad_ TileMatrixSet encoding examples.

This was partly because unlike most projected CRS, EPSG:3035 (Lambert Azimuhal Equal Area for Europe, based on ETRS89) defines a _Northing, Easting_ axis order.
In hope of minimizing the re-occurrence of such axis order confusion in the future, an optional `orderedAxes` was added to the TileMatrixSet definition
which can highlight the CRS order (without overriding it) to help ensure the consistency and correct interpretation of encoded definitions.

The order of the bounding box coordinates (which should actually be ignored by clients, and was made optional) as well as that of the `pointOfOrigin`
(`topLeftCorner` in previous version) coordinates should have been flipped, `[ 5500000.0, 2000000.0 ]` being the correct `pointOfOrigin` for all tile matrices.
The correct bounding box would be northing / Y going from 1,000,000.0 to 5,500,000.0, and easting / X going from 2,000,000.0 to 6,500,000.0, i.e.
`lowerLeft` being `[ 1000000.0, 2000000.0 ]` and `upperRight` being `[ 5500000.0, 6500000.0 ]`.

=== Correction of mistakes and inconsistencies in UML, XML and JSON encodings
In addition to the _EuropeanETRS89_LAEAQuad_ axis order confusion, a number of reported mistakes and inconsistencies were corrected in this new version:

- The encoding examples used curved quotes rather than straight quotes, making them invalid JSON and XML.
- The _WorldMercatorWGS84Quad_ tile matrices were wrongly assigned to a `tileHeight` property rather than `tileMatrices` in its JSON encoding.
- The _WorldMercatorWGS84Quad_ tile matrix definitions were off by one (`scaleDenominator`, `matrixWidth` and `matrixHeight` would have been correct for the following TileMatrix identifier).
- The _WorldMercatorWGS84Quad_ `topLeftCorner` (now `pointOfOrigin`) were wrong (geographic coordinates rather than projected coordinates).
- The `WorldCRS84QuadVariableWidth.json` example encoding of a TileMatrixSet with variable widths had the same identifier as the regular _WorldCRS84Quad_ tile matrix set.
This example is not registered on the OGC NA registry, and has been removed as it was mostly a duplication of the _GNOSISGlobalGrid_ tile matrix set, with the only exception of
adding an additional tile matrix. That extra lower zoom level tile matrix 0 made tile matrices correspond with the registered _WorldCRS84Quad_ tile matrix set definition, except for the variable width coalescence factors.
The _CDB1GlobalGrid_ was added as an additional example of a variable width tile matrix set instead.
